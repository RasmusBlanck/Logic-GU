We consider two calculi employed to answer the question of our title: extended constructability, and symbiosis. These calculi were employed in order to study formalism freeness and its dual, logical entanglement, concepts introduced in the speaker's latest book GÃ¶del, Tarski and the Lure of Natural Language (Cambridge 2020).

Broader questions motivating this study are, among others: is natural (mathematical) language autonomous with respect to formal languages? Does a given semantically presented mathematical concept always have an implicit logic attached to it? What is the semantic point of view and how is it implemented in foundational practice?
