    My expertise is in proof theory and its application to computational logic.
    I am particularly interested in expressibility, complexity, and deductive strength in fixed point logics.
    Other topics that I have worked on and/or are currently pursuing include relative computability, reverse mathematics, ordinal analysis, computational content of proofs, automata theory and games.

    Early research on models of arithmetic including compositional theories of truth and transplendent models.
    Later, focus shifted towards Dependence logic and generalized quantifiers as well as the characterization of logical constants. 
    Also interested in the cognitive aspects of logical reasoning.
